# forum-nextjs
Forum website with NextJS and Firebase

This website is made with NextJS and Firebase.
The aim is for me to practice React.

Pushing to github:
git add .
git commit -m "Testing if commit works"
git push origin main

Making sure my contribution is visible (setting email address in GitBash so it is the same to my GitHub account):
$ git config user.email "andrey.strelkovv@gmail.com"
